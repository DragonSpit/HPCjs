# High Performance Computing Algorithms in JavaScript

Faster and Better Algorithms, starting with high performance sorting:
- LSD Radix Sort for unsigned integer arrays. 5X to 50X faster than JavaScript's built-in array sort.
This sort algorithm is not in-place, however.
Discussion, benchmarks and example in https://duvanenko.tech.blog/2017/06/15/faster-sorting-in-javascript/
- LSD Radix Sort for arrays of user defined classes by an unsigned integer key. This is a stable sort,
while JavaScript built-in is not stable.
Discussion, benchmarks and example in https://duvanenko.tech.blog/2017/07/10/sorting-arrays-of-objects-in-javascript-with-radix-sort/

Even higher performance coming soon for both of these algorithms, with support for more data types.

If you have a specific needs for higher performance algorithms, let us know.
